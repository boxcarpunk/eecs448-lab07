isEmpty always returns true.

removeFront and removeBack never try to remove any values, they always return false.
This means that they always think the list is empty which is most likely due to isEmpty not working.
They probably test whether the list is empty using isEmpty before trying to remove any items.

addBack does not add to the back of the list, it adds to the front of the list.
